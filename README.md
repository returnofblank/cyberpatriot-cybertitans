**What needs to be complete**
  + Log the changed passwords of administrators (Not secure but whatever)
  + Organize the script, as of now, the categorization is a bit over the place
  + Set up auto disabling of services such as apache or nginx
  + Allow removal of SUID/GUID files through TUI
  + Allow removal of attributes through TUI
  + Make code more efficient (It's fine as is, but repeated opening of files through redirects is a little inefficient)
